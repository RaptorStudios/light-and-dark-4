# How to contribute :octocat:
More than anythig this project needs an artist, or I will end up scraping the Internet for 2D sprites.
Some help coding would also be nice, both on core and secondary features of the engine.
An overall UX redesign is also very much needed.

This is not a project I will abandon:
- I have structured it with the goal in mind of being able to work on it even after long pauses
- My record is clean: I have developed many side projects, some of which over multiple years, bringing them to the end
- I have a story I crave to tell, and passion for coding: both alone would be enough to keep this project going
