# How to contribute :octocat:
More than anythig this project needs an artist, or I will end up scraping the Internet for 2D sprites.
Some help coding would also be nice, both on core and secondary features of the engine.
And finally, when the engine will be ready, it will be possible to contribute by creating new maps using the editors.

If you'd like to join the fun, write me at: rpt at altervista.org
